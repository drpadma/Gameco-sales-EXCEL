# Game-sco-Sales
As I developed my foundation, I worked with Game&#39;sco&#39;s sales statistics on video
games. I was asked to perform an end-to-end analysis of data from 1980 to 2017 in
order to get insights for boosting global sales.
I began my analysis using the industry standard tool &quot;Excel&quot; based on the project
brief provided by the company. This analysis involved data cleaning (removing
duplicates, missing data, and incorrect data), analytical methods to derive insights,
and visualization using pivot tables and the various charts offered by Excel. Lastly,
presented it to the stakeholders as a presentation.
The above-mentioned attachments include the project brief, raw data, analysis, and
final main presentations.
